# Qlik script snippets working with REST connector

Helpful Qlik script snippets in combination with REST connector. The WITH CONNECTION block has the magic to make a REST call dynamic and to pass variables defined before. 

```
LET vBaseAPIurl = 'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos';

// Get current date/time into ISO format 2018-01-01T00:00:00.000Z
LET vDateTo = Date(Today(),'YYYY-MM-DD') & 'T' & Time(Now(), 'hh:mm:ss') & '.000Z';

// Define your Json-Body here
SET vJsonFilter = {
  "dateFrom": "2018-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",
  "dateTo": "$(vDateTo)"
};
// replace 1xquote with 2xquote and remove line-break amd tabulator chars
LET vJsonFilter = PurgeChar(Replace(vJsonFilter,'"','""'),CHR(13)&CHR(10)&CHR(8));

// load block generated by Select Data wizard goes here 
RestConnectorMasterTable:
SQL SELECT 
   // block generated by Select Data that loads the Json-structure
FROM JSON ...
// with block added by you
WITH CONNECTION (
    URL "$(vBaseAPIurl)/endpoint/method"
    ,QUERY "pagesize" "1000"
    //,HTTPHEADER "Cache-Control" "no-cache"
    ,HTTPHEADER "Authorization" "Bearer $(vToken)"
    ,HTTPHEADER "Content-Type" "application/json"
    //,HTTPHEADER "X-HTTP-Method-Override" "PUT",
    //,BODY "{""path"":""$(vAttribute)""}"
    //,BODY "$(vJsonBody)"
); 
```

##Autocalendar Fields
If you write script yourself, not using the Add Data wizard, you won't get the auto-calendar dimensions unless you copy/paste this block at the end of your script. Edit the line that says "DERIVE FIELDS" with your date field names.

```
[autoCalendar]: 
DECLARE FIELD DEFINITION Tagged ('$date')
FIELDS
  Dual(Year($1), YearStart($1)) AS [Year] Tagged ('$axis', '$year')
  ,Dual('Q'&Num(Ceil(Num(Month($1))/3)),Num(Ceil(NUM(Month($1))/3),00)) AS [Quarter] Tagged ('$quarter', '$cyclic')
  ,Dual(Year($1)&'-Q'&Num(Ceil(Num(Month($1))/3)),QuarterStart($1)) AS [YearQuarter] Tagged ('$yearquarter', '$qualified')
  ,Dual('Q'&Num(Ceil(Num(Month($1))/3)),QuarterStart($1)) AS [_YearQuarter] Tagged ('$yearquarter', '$hidden', '$simplified')
  ,Month($1) AS [Month] Tagged ('$month', '$cyclic')
  ,Dual(Year($1)&'-'&Month($1), monthstart($1)) AS [YearMonth] Tagged ('$axis', '$yearmonth', '$qualified')
  ,Dual(Month($1), monthstart($1)) AS [_YearMonth] Tagged ('$axis', '$yearmonth', '$simplified', '$hidden')
  ,Dual('W'&Num(Week($1),00), Num(Week($1),00)) AS [Week] Tagged ('$weeknumber', '$cyclic')
  ,Date(Floor($1)) AS [Date] Tagged ('$axis', '$date', '$qualified')
  ,Date(Floor($1), 'D') AS [_Date] Tagged ('$axis', '$date', '$hidden', '$simplified')
//   ,If (DayNumberOfYear($1) <= DayNumberOfYear(Today()), 1, 0) AS [InYTD] 
//   ,Year(Today())-Year($1) AS [YearsAgo] 
//   ,If (DayNumberOfQuarter($1) <= DayNumberOfQuarter(Today()),1,0) AS [InQTD] 
//   ,4*Year(Today())+Ceil(Month(Today())/3)-4*Year($1)-Ceil(Month($1)/3) AS [QuartersAgo] 
//   ,Ceil(Month(Today())/3)-Ceil(Month($1)/3) AS [QuarterRelNo] 
//   ,If(Day($1)<=Day(Today()),1,0) AS [InMTD] 
//   ,12*Year(Today())+Month(Today())-12*Year($1)-Month($1) AS [MonthsAgo] 
//   ,Month(Today())-Month($1) AS [MonthRelNo] 
//   ,If(WeekDay($1)<=WeekDay(Today()),1,0) AS [InWTD] 
//   ,(WeekStart(Today())-WeekStart($1))/7 AS [WeeksAgo] 
//   ,Week(Today())-Week($1) AS [WeekRelNo] 
;

DERIVE FIELDS FROM FIELDS myDateField1, [My Date Field 2] USING [autoCalendar] ;
```

Enjoy.
